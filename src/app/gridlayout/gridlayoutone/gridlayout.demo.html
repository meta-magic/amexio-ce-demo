                                            This example demonstrates how to reposition content in a view by stacking
                                            multiple grids on top of one another. The goal
                                            of the example is to retain a logical markup structure while still
                                            allowing content to be split up and positioned on the grid. Case
                                            in point: From a HTML semantics standpoint, the main area should
                                            come before the sidebar area.

                                            shows how stacking two grids allows the sidebar items to appear as if they
                                            are placed on the same grid as the main content
                                            while they are in reality placed in a separate grid positioned within
                                            and superimposed on top of the original grid. A detailed breakdown

                                <br> The solution provided here is limited by the lack of support for subgrids. If
                                subgrids were available, the solution would be more refined. That said, the lack
                                of subgrid was what brought me to this solution, and it has practical applications
                                well outside of the current demo. So maybe not having subgrid has opened the
                                door to other more interesting opportunities?
